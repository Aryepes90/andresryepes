## About Me

I work at the intersection of financial markets and data science — combining hands-on derivatives trading experience with quantitative modeling and machine learning.

My background spans **live futures and options trading** (ES, NQ, CL, SPY), **commercial credit and counterparty risk analysis**, and **algorithmic strategy development**. I'm currently building toward a full-time role in quantitative research, data-driven investment analysis, or trading analytics at a hedge fund, prop trading firm, or systematic trading desk.
